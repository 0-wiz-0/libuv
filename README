This is the new networking layer for Node. Its purpose is to abstract
IOCP on windows and libev on Unix systems. We intend to eventually contain
all platform differences in this library.

The library shall be considered part of Node despite being in a separate
repository. It is released under the same license
https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/LICENSE
