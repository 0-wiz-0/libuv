This is the new networking layer for Node. Its purpose is to abstract
IOCP on windows and libev on Unix systems. We intend to eventually contain
all platform differences in this library.

## Supported Platforms

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 2000. Build either Visual
Studio or MingW.

Linux 2.6 and MacOS using the GCC toolchain.

Solaris 121 and later using GCC toolchain.

## Design

The goal of this library is to provide high-concurrency high-performance I/O
on all operating systems. This is a large undertaking. Some of the API
decisions may seem arbitrary but are actually borne out of various specific
platform issues.

## oio_read_start(), oio_read_stop()

Originally we wanted to provide a asynchronous read function that was
similar to WSARecv().
